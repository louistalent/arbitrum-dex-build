Site</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As part of the Site, Balancer provides access to a decentralized finance\r\n        application (“Application” or “Balancer Protocol app”) on the Ethereum\r\n        blockchain, that allows swappers or liquidity providers of Ethereum\r\n        assets (“Cryptocurrency Assets”) to transact using smart contracts\r\n        (“Smart Contracts”). Use of the Balancer Protocol may require that you\r\n        pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Ethereum network to perform a\r\n        transaction. You acknowledge and agree that Balancer has no control over\r\n        any activities, transactions, the method of payment of any transactions,\r\n        or any actual processing of payments of transactions. You must ensure\r\n        that you have a sufficient balance to complete any transaction on the\r\n        Balancer Protocol before initiating such transaction. You should not\r\n        take or refrain from taking any action based on any information\r\n        contained on the Site or any other available information at any time.\r\n        Before you make any legal, technical, or financial decisions involving\r\n        the Services, you should seek independent professional advice from a\r\n        licensed and qualified individual in the area for which such advice\r\n        would be appropriate.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        You acknowledge and agree that Balancer has no control over any\r\n        transactions conducted through the Balancer Protocol, the method of\r\n        payment of any transactions or any actual payments of transactions\r\n        including use of any third-party services such as Metamask, or other\r\n        wallet services. Likewise, you must ensure that you have a sufficient\r\n        balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored at your Balancer\r\n        Protocol-compatible wallet address (“Cryptocurrency Wallet”) to complete\r\n        any transaction on the Balancer Protocol or the Ethereum network before\r\n        initiating such transaction.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"subsection\">\r\n      <h2>3.

You acknowledge that the Site and your use of the Site present\r\n        certain risks, including without limitation the following risks:\r\n      </h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Balancer\r\n          Protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a\r\n          swapping pair or liquidity pool. Prices of digital currencies, tokens\r\n          and/or other digital assets fluctuate day by day or even minute by\r\n          minute. The value of your available balance could surge or drop\r\n          suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of\r\n          tokens could decrease to zero. Prices of tokens are prone to\r\n          significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed\r\n          legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber\r\n          crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market\r\n          enthusiasm, disproportionate loss in confidence, or manipulation by\r\n          others in the market.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risks associated with accessing the Balancer Protocol through third\r\n          party web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own\r\n          diligence on those interfaces to understand and accept the risks that\r\n          use entails. You are also responsible for doing your own diligence on\r\n          those interfaces to understand and accept any fees that those\r\n          interfaces may charge.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Risks associated with any Smart Contracts with which you interact.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Although Balancer does not have access to your assets, you are\r\n          reminded and acknowledge that at any time, your access to your\r\n          Cryptocurrency Assets through third party wallet services, unrelated\r\n          to Balancer or the Balancer.Fi website, may be suspended or terminated\r\n          or there may be a delay in your access or use of your Cryptocurrency\r\n          Assets, which may result in the Cryptocurrency Assets diminishing in\r\n          value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          You are reminded of the inherent risks with digital assets and\r\n          decentralized finance including the fact that tokens are not legal\r\n          tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies,\r\n          which are regulated and backed by local governments and central banks,\r\n          tokens are based only on technology and user consensus, which means\r\n          that in cases of manipulations or market panic, central governments\r\n          will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability,\r\n          maintain liquidity or protect their value. There is a possibility that\r\n          certain transactions cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle,\r\n          or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on\r\n          the market situation and/or market volume. Transactions may be\r\n          irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or\r\n          accidental transactions are not recoverable. Some blockchain\r\n          transactions are deemed to be completed when recorded on a public\r\n          ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another\r\n          party initiated the transaction.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in\r\n          connection with tokens are still developing and evolving. It is\r\n          possible that your transactions or funds are, or may be in the future,\r\n          subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and\r\n          obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the\r\n          country or international level may materially and adversely affect the\r\n          use, transfer, exchange, and value of your tokens.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          The site and/or application may be wholly or partially suspended or\r\n          terminated for any or no reason, which may limit your access to your\r\n          Cryptocurrency Assets.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any\r\n          and all Applicable Laws in connection with your acceptance of these\r\n          Terms and your use of any part of the Site, including but not limited\r\n          to those related to taxes as well as reporting and disclosure\r\n          obligations.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          This list of risk factors is non-exhaustive, and other risks, arising\r\n          either now or in the future, could additionally be relevant and\r\n          applicable to you in making an informed judgment to accept, or\r\n          continue to accept, these Terms and/or use, or continue to use the\r\n          Site.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Violating our rules may result in our intervention.</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        You agree and acknowledge that if you use the Site and its Services to\r\n        engage in conduct prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right to\r\n        completely or partially restrict or revoke your access to the Services\r\n        at our sole discretion.
